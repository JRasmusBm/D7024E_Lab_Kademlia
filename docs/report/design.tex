The figure below represents a high level architectural overview of the
implementation.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{High level architecture of a kademlia node in our implementation.}
\end{figure}

By looking at the figure, the main function
initializes its network and cliserver before entering a loop that keeps the
node alive until an 'exit' message is received through the cli. This will
terminate the loop and thus terminate the node itself.
