\subsection{Sprint 1}\label{sec:sprint-1}

After a discussion we estimated that we will complete the mandatory objectives 
for this project during the first sprint. For the backlog, see our Github.
\footnote{\href{https://github.com/JRasmusBm/D7024E_Lab_Kademlia}{https://github.com/JRasmusBm/D7024E\_Lab\_Kademlia}}\\

\textbf{Networking:} A node shall be able to ping any other node, a node should be able to join the Kademlia network and a node shall be able to find any other node in the Kademlia network.\\

\textbf{Objects:} Any node must be able to upload an object (key:val pair) that will be stored on appropriate nodes according to the kademlia principle. Any node must be able to find and download any object stored on at least one node of the kademlia network.\\

\textbf{CLI:} Each node must be able to execute the following commands: put, get and exit. Exit terminates the node, get takes a hash as its arguement and outputs the node and the value sought if it exists. Put takes a value as an arguement and outputs the hash if uploaded successfully.\\

\textbf{Testing:} At least a 50\% testing coverage of the implementation.\\

\textbf{Containers:} A network of at least 50 nodes must be spinned up by containers where each node is a seperate container.


\subsubsection{Sprint 1 reflections}\label{sec:sprint-1-reflections}
As this report is due 48 hours before the end of sprint 1 we have not fully completed all planned objectives at this point, but we are close to complete all objectives and might still do so before the actual end of sprint 1.\\

\textbf{Containers:} We have a network of 50 nodes spinned up by containers and each node is in a seperate container. This objective is complete.\\

\textbf{Testing:} We are continously adding tests to our code, this objective should be complete before the official end of sprint 1.\\

\textbf{CLI:} We have a simple shell that can connect and communicate with a server in each node. The functionality itself is dependent on the RPCs and not fully operational at this point.\\

\textbf{Objects and Networking:} These are our RPCs and require the most work. They are beginning to become operational but are still work in progress at this point.

\subsection{Sprint 2}\label{sec:sprint-2}
The plan is to implement all qualifying objectives except for concurrency after implementing any remaining mandatory objectives. For the backlog, see our Github.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/JRasmusBm/D7024E_Lab_Kademlia}{https://github.com/JRasmusBm/D7024E\_Lab\_Kademlia}}\\

\textbf{Object expiration:} Implement Time-To-Live(TTL) functionality. When TTL expires the data object is silently deleted. But the TTL is reset every time the object is requested and transmitted.\\

\textbf{Object expiration delay:} To prevent objects from expiring, the original node that uploaded the object sends a refresh command to reset the TTL without actually requesting the object. As long as the uploading node can contact the storing nodes, the object should never expire.\\

\textbf{Forget CLI command:} The command takes the hashnr of the object that is to be removed. (By stopping the refresh of TTL).\\

\textbf{RESTful application interface:} A restful HTTP interface so it may be integrated with web applications or other applications at some point. Implement POST-objects and GET-objects.\\

\textbf{Testing:} At least a 80\% test coverage of the implementation.
