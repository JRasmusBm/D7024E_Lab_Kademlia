After a discussion we estimated that we will complete the mandatory objectives 
for this project during the first sprint. For the backlog, see our Github.

\textbf{Networking:} A node shall be able to ping any other node, a node should be able to join the Kademlia network and a node shall be able to find any other node in the Kademlia network.\\

\textbf{Objects:} Any node must be able to upload an object (key:val pair) that will be stored on appropriate nodes according to the kademlia principle. Any node must be able to find and download any object stored on at least one node of the kademlia network.\\

\textbf{CLI:} Each node must be able to execute the following commands: put, get and exit. Exit terminates the node, get takes a hash as its arguement and outputs the node and the value sought if it exists. Put takes a value as an arguement and outputs the hash if uploaded successfully.\\

\textbf{Testing:} At least a 50\% testing coverage of the implementation.\\

\textbf{Containers:} A network of at least 50 nodes must be spinned up by containers where each node is a seperate container.\\
