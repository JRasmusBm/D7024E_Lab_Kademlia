\section{Testing}\label{sec:testing}

It was decided to prioritize testing and quality control throughout the
project. This, because none of the group participants had previously
worked in Golang and it seemed a very beneficial way to learn the ins
and outs of robust software engineering in the language. In the end,
a near 100\% unit test coverage was achieved.

Since Golang is a statically typed language, common techniques of monkey
patching or spying are in general not available.  These have to be
replaced with idiomatic Golang. 

In Golang, the main way to achieve dependency injection is by
the use of interfaces. An \mintinline{go}{interface} is a way to specify
the abstract behavior of a type, instead of its concrete implementation.
It allows for changing the behavior of a method by calling it with a
different \mintinline{go}{struct} (concrete type), implementing an
interface specified by the method.

Thus, well tested programs can be constructed by introducing boundaries
between the I/O layers of the application and its business logic.
Integration tests can then be used to test the ``glue''  between the
layers, and unit tests can be employed to ensure that all the various
aspects of a given method are covered.
