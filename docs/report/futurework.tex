\section{Limitations and future work}\label{sec:limitations and future work}
Some current limitations and possible future work.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cli: Encode and decode messages between the server and the client.
For example by using json as we do in the kademlia network.
  \item Security: Implement encryption across the network.
  \item Performance: Implement full support for concurrency and thread safety.
  \item RESTful API: To be able to integrate our kademlia implementation
with web applications a HTTP interface could be developed.
  \item Time-to-live: Implement TTL so that stored objects can be set to be deleted,
as well as a refresh command/functionality that keeps objects alive until instructed
otherwise.
\end{itemize}

Certainly other topics such as developing some kind of permission hierarchy between nodes in the network and more could be considered.
